I feel like if this was not just one question and one response thing, and it was a longer conversation, someone being happy all the time would not be too good.","I would not want it when I need real advice. and how to deal with people because i know that the chatbot uses a collective response, so it will give me a response that is biased toward the selected population and i would prefer to communicate with a real human being when it comes to dealing with other human beings."

It felt unnatural and lacking emotion and details.","what is the duration of knowing this chatbot, and background information. For presentation is approaching, the person might know something about the presentation that might help them respond.","For anger, I want them to be encouraging. This is how everybody drives here. You have to get used to it or something. If you get an angry response, it might make you more angry and do bad things.","You might use the chatbot less if you know that it is a chatbot. If the feeling is too great, you might want to be alone, not talk to anyone. If the feeling level is middle, I might just use the chatbot."
